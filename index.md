# Cheatsheets
A document repo to find code you've used before - and fast.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300}


Coding is a perishable skill - there is just too much to remember. We also don't document *all* things, especially the one-off lines of code we used as quick fixes.

This repo serves as that documentation.
